commands to run:
```
make build
make execute
make clean
```

- `make build` does the preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking stage (i.e generate object files and final executable in the  `/build` directory)
- `make execute` simply runs the executable
- `make clean` removes the `build directory` if you want to rebuild your program
